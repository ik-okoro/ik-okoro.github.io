I used pandas and plotly to perform an in depth look at the five main soccer leagues over the past 10 seasons:


*   England's Premier League

*   France's Ligue 1
*   Germany's Bundesliga


*   Italy's Serie A, and

*   Spain's La Liga

I explored several factors to determine if it's fair for the football community to view Ligue 1 as the weakest of the pack. 

You can check out the Github repo [here](https://github.com/ik-okoro/DS20-Unit-1-Build-1-Football-Leagues-Exploration) and the medium link for my blog post [here](https://medium.com/@ik.o.okoro/is-the-term-farmers-league-unfair-to-ligue-1-f61eeb8fbd4?source=friends_link&sk=d7b42592c1149bfd899f04f20b41c8b9). 

Plotly is an interactive graphing library, so if you don't want to sift through the whole notebook but would rather have fun with the visualizations, you can view some of  them in my Plotly account [here](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~ik.okoro). If you have any ideas for how I could expand on this work, please let me know! I'm definitely interested.
