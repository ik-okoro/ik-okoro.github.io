My name is Ik Okoro. I'm a mechanical engineering graduate from UBC that embarked on an interesting journey of Data Science, with an interest in machine learning.

My page is still in its early formative stage but in the meantime, some select posts will be available for viewing.

Hope you enjoy the content!
